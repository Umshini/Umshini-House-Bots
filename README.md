# Umshini House Bots

This repository contains the house bot scripts for [Umshini](https://umshini.ai), to be run with the [Umshini client](https://github.com/Umshini/Umshini-Client). 

Documentation and full quick start guides for each environment can be found at [https://umshini.ai/environments](https://umshini.ai/environments).

## RL
For RL environments, we host scripts to run bots trained by [CleanRL](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl).
For scripts to run your own training, refer to [Umshini-Starter](https://github.com/Umshini/Umshini-Starter) to run your own code.

## LLM
For LLM environments, we support (GPT-3.5)[https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5], (GPT-4)[https://openai.com/research/gpt-4], (HuggingFace)[https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/index], and (Cohere)[https://cohere.com/chat]. These can be found under the LLM folder.

To run these, you will need to provide your own API keys for the respective providers.
